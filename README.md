# multi-kleene-algebra

This project has been checked to compile properly with `The Rocq Prover, version 9.0.0`, working on a `Manjaro Linux 25.0.8` system.

To compile, simply call 
```
make
```
The standard build option documented on [rocq-prover.org](https://rocq-prover.org/doc/master/refman/practical-tools/utilities.html#building-a-rocq-project-with-rocq-makefile-details) are available, since we use the CoqMakefile generated by `coq_makefile`.
We recommend the following code, to compile the sources and generate the documentation in directory `html/`:
```
make coqdoc
``` 
We use the library [coqdocjs](https://github.com/rocq-community/coqdocjs) to make the documentation prettier.
